This project implements a real-time digital clock on an FPGA using a clear separation of data path and control path design. The Datapath consists of hardware modules such as adders, multiplexers, and registers to perform second, minute, and hour counting operations, while the control path generates the necessary control signals for sequencing and value updates. The binary counters for hours, minutes, and seconds are converted to BCD format to drive the seven-segment display for human-readable output. A clock divider module was designed to generate a precise 1 Hz clock from the 100 MHz onboard clock of the Nexys A7 (Artix-7 XC7A100T-CSG324) FPGA, enabling accurate real-time operation. The complete design was written in Verilog HDL, synthesized, and validated on hardware using Xilinx Vivado.
